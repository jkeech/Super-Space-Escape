[**Intro to level**]

The creatures on this planet could really be a problem, but you 
realize that there are bigger issues on this planet.  Because your 
ship has crash-landed it has ignited the ozone layer of the planet 
and for now all you can do is survive until you find help or find 
a way to escape from this horrid planet.
Goal: Find the exit before time runs out (ozone layer for this part 
of the planet is gone) or you will die...

[**In this level**]
Introduce the time limit concept and give a reason for why levels 
are timed. 
	Time limit 60 seconds. (rough estimate change if needed)
