[**Intro to level**]

After swimming for a while, you begin to just drift down the river and
emerge onto the bank of an adjoining lake.  You dry off and see smoke 
and a feint sound of what seems like a civilization.  the ozone seems 
to have stabalized now, but it is getting late and you would like to 
investigate the city in the distance.  
Goal: Get into the city before night fall or the gates will close and
you will be locked out of the city...

[**In this level**]
Transition to a castle/city level.  Introducing the knights/gurds in 
the city.  
	Time limit: 300 seconds

--Alternate option--
If you don't make it within the time limit, return to this same level 
except have the gate locked without any keys around, with more enemies 
and have you survive untill you find a good place for shelter...
if that is completed successfully, return back to this level and try 
again..
