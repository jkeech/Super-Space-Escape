[**Intro to level**]

You awake with the stench of scorched earth filling your nostrils. 
You open your eyes and realize that you are no longer on board your 
spaceship. You see the burnt trees and the remains of your ship 
lying in a smoldering heap of twisted melting metal, while smaller 
bits of your ship come falling down being vaporized as they enter 
this planet's atmosphere.  You don't see any of your ship mates here 
and assume the worst. The surrounding don't look familiar and the 
sounds off in the distance tell you that surviving this and returning 
back to [insert home planet name] isn't going to be easy...

[**In this level**]
I was thinking that this would be more of a tutorial level that gets 
the player acustomed to the game basics:
	moving
	inventory
	items (picking up and or equiping weapons)
	fighting monsters
	time limit (unlimited on this level)
