Please note: when tested on the device, our application will crash due to a bug with XNA Media Player if the device is plugged in to the computer. 

##Project Contents
This project contains the source code and executables for our game as well as several other applications that were created to aid in the development of the game.

###The Game
The game is developed in C# using the XNA framework. It is intended to run on the Windows Phone 7 platform.

###Map Editor
The map editor allows for the creation and manipulation of level files that are used within the game. The map editor is a standalone Windows Form application written in C#.

###AutoID Generation for tilesets
This small application overlays an ID onto each tile in a tileset image for easy debugging of the levels files and the game engine.
